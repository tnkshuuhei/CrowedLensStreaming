# Lens Ã— SuperFluid

## The problem CrowdLensStreaming solves

This enables fans and supporters to engage their peers in crowdfunding, fostering a strong community and dynamic crowdfunding.

Challenges in crowdfunding.

- Static mechanisms like ALL or Nothing
- One-way request for financial support from supporters
- Costly return offers such as food or products

With this product,

- Money can be withdrawn at any time, even if the target amount is not reached.
- Fans and supporters can set up multiple crowdfunding projects themselves
- Success is the best return. A system where the community voluntarily supports the product.
- This could be utilised when social apps such as YouTube, Twitch as well as Lens are connected to web3, and can be used for a wide range of applications such as supporting entrepreneurs or specific projects.
- You are not the only supporter. You don't have to be rich.
- Expand your fan community while increasing your support.

These are only possible with Lens x Superfluid!

## Challenges I ran into

In fact, it was my first experience to create a single application all by myself.

- Solidity compile error
- Type definitions and error handling in Typescript
- Error handling of Route/NextImage using Next.js
- Handle Query using LensClient
- Contract State using SuperFluid
  To solve these problems, I read the Docs several times, completed the tutorials uploaded on YouTube, and asked questions in the Discord community.
